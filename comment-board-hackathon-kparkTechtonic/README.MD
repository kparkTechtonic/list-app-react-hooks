# Comment Board Hackathon!!!

This assignment does have a few requirements but is heavily driven by creativity.  Given a predefined schema and therefore limited options with a data structure create something interesting!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

Your application MUST support the following features.

- CRUD (Create/POST, Read/GET, Update/PUT, Delete/DELETE) functionality on the comment collection.
- The front end of your application should leverage EACH of the above CRUD routes that you have created.

## Inspiration

We have seen a handful of really exciting and creative projects here is a list of creations from prior classes.

- Battleship game shared between 2 players by matching the author field and using comment body to attack a location on the grid.
- POST Malone interactive commentboard website that was full of Post Malone easter eggs.
- D&D character sheet generator.
- Superhero Generator.
