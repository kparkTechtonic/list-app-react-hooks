## For this project, we will be re-creating an iconic website

For this repository or follow the provided GitHub classroom link (if we've given a GitHub classroomlink you won't need to fork but may if you'd like to maintain a copy for your portfolio) and then clone down the repository to your machine using ```git clone```.

We've given you some very basic boilerplate, some image assets and linked a blank stylesheet as well as the bootstrap.css stylesheet.  Your job is to re-create the site's visual layout to the best of your ability.  The expectation is not that your design is pixel-perfect, but that you re-create the overall layout with effective use of semantic HTML and CSS.  Start with the overall layout and then work your way down to more specific items.  

Once you've got the majority of the visual layout completed, start focusing on smaller details and start making your webpage responsive, so it looks great on any device.  

For this project you may use bootstrap as much or as little as you'd like, but do not implement any JavaScript or anything else other than HTML and CSS (CDN's are fine).  

When you're finished, ensure your project is ready to be submitted then commit and push your changes and paste the link to your completed repository in the assignments roster google doc.
