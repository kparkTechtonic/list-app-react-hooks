// ************ 4. (BONUS) There is a bug in the 'populateTableUI' function... see if you can find it and update the function ************

// ************ 5. (BONUS #2) Comment out line 67 in ../index.HTML and write your own 'populateTableUI' function in app.js ************


// Now that youâ€™ve cloned your project lets start by testing our code. Let's start live 
//server and open up our project in the browser. Open up your console and you should see 
//some logs outputting book objects. These object are predefined in books.json and added to
//our database called library_database in indexedDB. We can also navigate to the 
//application tab in the chrome console (storage in firefox) and take a look at the indexedDB 
//storage We created this for you in indexedDB.js if you feel inclined to take a look. 

// We've populated the table so the UI reflects what's currently in our local 
// library_database in indexedDB.  We've logged the database above so you can see exactly 
// what you're working with


// 1.) Now add functionality to remove a row  which will need remove the object from the books store in 
//indexedDB database as well as the UI once the delete operation is complete. This will take some 
//effort on the UI. Use the title as your UID (Unique identifier) which you can find in the application console
//in Chrome (storage in Firefox). 

// 2.) From here we want to be able to add a book. Hook up the form below the table to add a 
//book to the books store in indexedDB and auto-update the table without refreshing the page.
//Hint: This add operation is on the front page of DexieJS.  Both is and Table.put() can be 
// used to add this book. 


// 3.) Now make each table row editable and update the database when the edit is complete. This will
//take a lot of effort from the html to the js. Use the title as your UID (Unique identifier)
//which you can find in the application console
